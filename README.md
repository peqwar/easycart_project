## Introduction

EasyCart, Inc. is an e-commerce company based in Quito, Ecuador. It offers an online platform where users can purchase a variety of products, from technology to home and fashion items. The company has stood out for its focus on customer experience and convenience in the online purchasing process.

By January 2025, the company aims to reach $7 million in sales, for which investments have been made in technology and the expansion of its distribution and logistics network. 

## Problem Statement

To understand the company's status on its path towards the goal, an analysis of transactional and operational data from the company has been requested, with specific requirements from each area of the company:

- **Marketing**: They want a clear understanding of our customers based on their transactional behavior. 

- **Operations**: They want to know how demand is moving in each of the retailers to be able to plan team schedules and take actions to avoid a clash between demand and capacity. Additionally, they want to understand the rate of delivered or cancelled orders and the different incidents they are experiencing at an operational level.

- **C level**: Finally, from the company's leaders and managers, they want to know if, with the sales pace obtained to date, they will be able to reach the sales target by the end of the month.
